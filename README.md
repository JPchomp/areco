# Repository for San Antonio de Areco's Urban Water Network Expansion 

Project expanding the water infrastructure service in the southern area of the city of San Antonio de Areco. A lower income area located at the fringes of the existing network, its population experiences dramatic problems of waterlogging and lack of services. There is also a large number of plots of land that would allow for future housing and city expansion, but are currently vacant due to their unsuitability during wet weather.
This work independently presents a comprehensive project for drinking water, sewage and stormwater services incorporating the already existing network in the urban center. All documentation for the expansion is provided along with management recommendations.
