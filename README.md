# San Antonio de Areco's Urban Water Network Expansion 

Project expanding the water infrastructure service in the southern area of the city of [San Antonio de Areco](https://goo.gl/maps/DkiQZJwyMews3SYH7).

A lower income area located at the fringes of the existing network, its population experiences dramatic problems of waterlogging and lack of network services (gas, electricity, water, transportation, etc.). There is also a large number of plots of land that would allow for future housing and city expansion, but are currently vacant due to their unsuitability during wet weather. Interestingly enough, much of these new inundation problems stem from the urbanization of other higher income sectors and added drainage capacity of upstream productive fields, illustrating the relationship between urban-rural watershed management and housing.

This work independently presents a comprehensive project for drinking water, sewage and stormwater services incorporating the already existing network in the urban center. All documentation for the expansion is provided along with management recommendations [here](https://github.com/JPchomp/areco/blob/main/Expansi%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20red%20de%20Agua%20Urbana%20de%20San%20Antonio%20de%20Areco.pdf).
